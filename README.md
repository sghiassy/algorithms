# Algorithms in Javascript
### An interpretation on Algorithms in C by Robert Sedgewick

In going through the book 'Algorithms in C' by Robert Sedgewick, I decided that I wanted to implement the algorithms explained in JavaScript. 

I do this because as a front-end developer, I think that JavaScript gets the brunt end from a lot of hardcore Computer Science folks and I wanted to demonstrate that JavaScript is as capable as any other language. It has its flaws (actually it has tons of flaws) but its the only language that has a compiler on 99% of computers out there. And in that respect, its King.

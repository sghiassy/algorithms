# Algorithms in Javascript
### An interpretation on Algorithms in C by Robert Sedgewick

In going through the book 'Algorithms in C' by Robert Sedgewick, I decided that I wanted to implement the algorithms explained in JavaScript. 

I do this because as a front-end developer, I think that JavaScript gets the brunt end from a lot of hardcore Computer Science folks and I wanted to demonstrate that JavaScript is as capable as any other language. It has its flaws (actually it has tons of flaws) but its the only language that has a compiler on 99% of computers out there. And in that respect, its King.

My approach in reworking the algorithms is to not strictly adhere to the book's algorithm. A lot has changed since 1946. JavaScript is a much different animal than C, and the algorithms I generate these facts. Instead my approach focuses on showing how to accomplish these algorithms, using Object Oriented Programming and also doing things the JavaScript way. This usually results in the algorithms being much longer in length, but asymptotically, this has zero consequence.
